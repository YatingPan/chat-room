Do not include arguments that are not part of the provided list, and mention each identified argument only once. Format the output with arguments being mentioned using <arguments_mentioned>argument1,argument2...,argumentN</arguments_mentioned> and the list of arguments not being mentioned using <arguments_not>argument1,argument2,...,argumentN</arguments_not>.

List of arguments with brief explanation:
large data processing: AI can manage and process vast amounts of data more effectively.
diagnosis speed: AI can speed up the diagnosis process in healthcare by quickly identifying illnesses.
identification of rare symptoms: AI is good at spotting rare symptoms in healthcare data that humans might miss.
timeliness of diagnosis: AI contributes to more timely diagnoses in healthcare and can thus help to detect diseases at an early stage.
workload shift: AI helps free up medical staff's time, allowing them to focus on patient care and professional development.
support for medical staff: AI can act as a support system for medical staff by assisting with various clinical tasks.
interpersonal relationships: Care provided solely by AI can lead to interpersonal relationships being neglected.
danger of misdiagnosis: AI can increase the risk of misdiagnosis, necessitating human validation which might not always be feasible.
dehumanization: AI can contribute to the dehumanization of healthcare by prioritizing efficiency over patient-centered care.
data privacy: AI can pose significant risks to patient data privacy.
personalized treatment: AI can enhance personalized treatment by tailoring healthcare to individual patient needs.
treatment specification: AI can specify treatments by closely analyzing disease patterns and patient responses.
health monitoring: AI can improve health monitoring by continuously tracking patient health data.
accuracy improvement: AI can improve the accuracy of diagnoses and the comprehensiveness of treatments in healthcare.
cost reduction: AI can reduce costs in healthcare by streamlining operations and reducing resource utilization.
diagnosis interpretability: AI can make it difficult to understand how diagnoses are reached.
data bias and quality: AI can reflect issues in data quality, including bias, inaccuracy, and incompleteness, affecting healthcare decisions.
responsibility, accountability and liability: Determining responsibility for AI decisions in healthcare can be complex.
reliability: AI can offer more reliable performance in healthcare, unaffected by human limitations.
healthcare system integration challenge: AI integration into existing healthcare frameworks can be challenging.
trust in and acceptance of AI: Building trust and acceptance of AI among healthcare professionals and patients can be difficult.
upfront investment: The initial investment for implementing AI in healthcare can be substantial.
loss of human competences: Reliance on AI can lead to the erosion of traditional medical skills.
data misuse risk: AI can be misused for patient profiling in ways that compromise ethics and privacy.
AI transparency: Transparency in AI processes is often lacking in healthcare applications.
risk prevention: AI can enhance risk prevention in healthcare by predicting and mitigating potential health issues.
drug development: AI accelerates the drug development process, making it more efficient and less costly.
inequality in access: AI can exacerbate healthcare access inequalities.
job loss: AI can lead to job losses in the healthcare sector.
objectivity: AI can offer objectivity in medical diagnoses and treatments, minimizing human biases.
healthcare philosophy: AI may prioritize quick, high-tech interventions over addressing underlying lifestyle factors in healthcare.
adaptiveness: AI may struggle to adapt to new medical scenarios or unexpected conditions.
diverse language support: AI can facilitate healthcare delivery in multilingual contexts, improving accessibility.
pressure to be healthy: AI-driven health monitoring can increase pressure on individuals to maintain constant health vigilance.
data sharing obligation: Widespread AI use in healthcare can pressure individuals into sharing their personal health data.
moral dilemmas: AI can introduce moral dilemmas in healthcare decisions, challenging ethical norms.
right to ignorance: AI's capability to predict health outcomes can conflict with an individualâ€™s right to not know certain information.
integrated care coordination: AI facilitates smoother and more effective information exchange among healthcare stakeholders.
